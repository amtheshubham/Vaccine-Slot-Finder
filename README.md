# Vaccine Slot Finder

This is an app which I built for myself when I struggled to find a slot for vaccination.

Though, there are already other solutions available but I wanted to learn the scheduling in android.

On startup, the app asks for your pincode and then a Workmanager checks for any available slots frequently. When it finds any slot, It notifies the user!
